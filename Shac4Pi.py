# Shac = Smart House Access Control by House4Hack
# Objective : Fire up a XMPP based python client on a Raspberry Pi Model B (version 1)
#             such that it is able to persistently be logged into Gtalk, and such that when
#             commands or GPIO pin high/low commands are sent via XMPP buddies to this
#             account, it would set certain GPIO pins high and low, to actuate and trigger
#             a 2 Channel 5V Relay module such that it can actuate a gate remote or disengage
#             a magnetic lock.
